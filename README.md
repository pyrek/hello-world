# hello-world
Hello Git, hello Hub! My brain can't hold any more info, I need to put it somewhere! I also need Structure! And I want to learn a LOT more!

My name is Jens, as an artist I call me Pyrek. I also do fire shows, try to make my family happy, and learning stuff, for example computer programming, electronics, and music.
